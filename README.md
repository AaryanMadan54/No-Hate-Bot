# No-Hate-Bot
This is a Discord Bot that is coded in Python using discord.py. It can identify negative or hate words sent by the user, delete them from the chat and subsequently ask the user to refrain from using such words. The bot can also give inspiring quotes, news and music links from reddit. It can also kick or ban a user as required.
